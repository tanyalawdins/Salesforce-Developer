Simple Salesforce
*****************

Simple Salesforce is a basic Salesforce.com REST API client built for Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.2 and 3.3. The goal is to provide a very low-level interface to the API, returning a dictionary of the API JSON response.

You can find out more regarding the format of the results in the `Official Salesforce.com REST API Documentation`_

.. _Official Salesforce.com REST API Documentation: http://www.salesforce.com/us/developer/docs/api_rest/index.htm

Example
-------
There are two ways to gain access to Salesforce

The first is to simply pass the domain of your Salesforce instance and an access token straight to ``Salesforce()``

For example::

    from simple_salesforce import Salesforce
    sf = Salesforce(instance='na1.salesforce.com', session_id='')

If you have the full URL of your instance (perhaps including the schema, as is included in the OAuth2 request process), you can pass that in instead using ``instance_url``::

    from simple_salesforce import Salesforce
    sf = Salesforce(instance_url='https://na1.salesforce.com', session_id='')

There are also two means of autentication, one that uses username, password and security token and the other that uses IP filtering, username, password  and organizationId
    
To login using the security token method, simply include the Salesforce method and pass in your Salesforce username, password and token (this is usually provided when you change your password)::

    from simple_salesforce import Salesforce
    sf = Salesforce(username='myemail@example.com', password='password', security_token='token')

To login using IP-whitelist Organization ID method, simply use your Salesforce username, password and organizationId::

    from simple_salesforce import Salesforce
    sf = Salesforce(password='password', username='myemail@example.com', organizationId='OrgId')

If you'd like to enter a sandbox, simply add ``sandbox=True`` to your ``Salesforce()`` call.

For example::

    from simple_salesforce import Salesforce
    sf = Salesforce(username='myemail@example.com.sandbox', password='password', security_token='token', sandbox=True)

Note that specifying if you want to use a sandbox is only necessary if you are using the built-in username/password/security token authentication and is used exclusively during the authentication step.

Record Management
-----------------

To create a new 'Contact' in Salesforce::

    sf.Contact.create({'LastName':'Smith','Email':'example@example.com'})

This will return a dictionary such as ``{u'errors': [], u'id': u'003e0000003GuNXAA0', u'success': True}``

To get a dictionary with all the information regarding that record, use::

    contact = sf.Contact.get('003e0000003GuNXAA0')

To change that contact's last name from 'Smith' to 'Jones' and add a first name of 'John' use::

    sf.Contact.update('003e0000003GuNXAA0',{'LastName': 'Jones', 'FirstName': 'John'})

To delete the contact::

    sf.Contact.delete('003e0000003GuNXAA0')

To retrieve a list of deleted contacts between ``2013-10-20`` to ``2013-10-29``::

    import urllib
    sf.Contact.deleted(urllib.quote('2013-10-20T00:00:00+00:00'), urllib.quote('2013-10-29T00:00:00+00:00'))

Note that Update, Delete and Upsert actions return the associated `Salesforce HTTP Status Code`_

Queries
-------

It's also possible to write select queries in Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) and search queries in Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL).

SOQL queries are done via

::

    sf.query("SELECT Id, Email FROM Contact WHERE LastName = 'Jones'")

If, due to an especially large result, Salesforce adds a ``nextRecordsUrl`` to your query result, such as ``"nextRecordsUrl" : "/services/data/v26.0/query/01gD0000002HU6KIAW-2000"``, you can pull the additional results with either the ID or the full URL (if using the full URL, you must pass 'True' as your second argument)

::

    sf.query_more("01gD0000002HU6KIAW-2000")
    sf.query_more("/services/data/v26.0/query/01gD0000002HU6KIAW-2000", True)

As a convenience, to retrieve all of the results in a single local method call use

::

    sf.query_all("SELECT Id, Email FROM Contact WHERE LastName = 'Jones'")

SOSL queries are done via::

    sf.search("FIND {Jones}")

There is also 'Quick Search', which inserts your query inside the {} in the SOSL syntax. Be careful, there is no escaping!

::

    sf.quick_search("Jones")

Search and Quick Search return ``None`` if there are no records, otherwise they return a dictionary of search results.

More details about syntax is available on the `Salesforce Query Language Documentation Developer Website`_

.. _Salesforce Query Language Documentation Developer Website: http://www.salesforce.com/us/developer/docs/soql_sosl/index.htm

Other Options
-------------

To insert or update (upsert) a record using an external ID, use::

    sf.Contact.upsert('customExtIdField__c/11999',{'LastName': 'Smith','Email': 'smith@example.com'})

To retrieve basic metadata use::

    sf.Contact.metadata()

To retrieve a description of the object, use::

    sf.Contact.describe()

To retrieve a description of the record layout of an object by its record layout unique id, use::

    sf.Contact.describe_layout('39wmxcw9r23r492')

To retrieve a list of top level description of instance metadata, user::

    sf.describe()

    for x in sf.describe()["sobjects"]:
      print x["label"]


Additional Features
-------------------

There are a few helper classes that are used internally and available to you.

Included in them are ``SalesforceLogin``, which takes in a username, password, security token, optional boolean sandbox indicator and optional version and returns a touple of ``(session_id, sf_instance)`` where `session_id` is the session ID to use for authentication to Salesforce and ``sf_instance`` is the domain of the instance of Salesforce to use for the session.

For example, to use SalesforceLogin for a sandbox account you'd use::

    from simple_salesforce import SalesforceLogin
    session_id, instance = SalesforceLogin('myemail@example.com.sandbox', 'password', 'token', True)

Simply leave off the final ``True`` if you do not wish to use a sandbox.

Also exposed is the ``SFType`` class, which is used internally by the ``__getattr__()`` method in the ``Salesforce()`` class and represents a specific SObject type. ``SFType`` requires ``object_name`` (i.e. ``Contact``), ``session_id`` (an authentication ID), ``sf_instance`` (hostname of your Salesforce instance), and an optional ``sf_version``

To add a Contact using the default version of the API you'd use::

    from simple_salesforce import SFType
    contact = SFType('Contact','sesssionid','na1.salesforce.com')
    contact.create({'LastName':'Smith','Email':'example@example.com'})

To use a proxy server between your client and the SalesForce endpoint, use the proxies argument when creating SalesForce object.
The proxy argument is the same as what requests uses, a map of scheme to proxy URL::

    proxies = {
      "http": "http://10.10.1.10:3128",
      "https": "http://10.10.1.10:1080",
    }
    SalesForce(instance='na1.salesforce.com', session_id='', proxies=proxies)

All results are returned as JSON converted OrderedDict to preserve order of keys from REST responses.
